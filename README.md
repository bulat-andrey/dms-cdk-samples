# Getting Started with AWS CDK for TypeScript


The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source software development framework that allows you to define your cloud infrastructure using programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to set up and run a CDK project in TypeScript.


## Prerequisites


Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:


1. **Node.js** (version 12.x or later): You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

2. **AWS CLI**: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) by following the instructions on the [AWS CLI documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

3. **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account to deploy your CDK application. If you don't have one, you can create a new account on the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com).


## Step 1: Install the AWS CDK Toolkit


The AWS CDK Toolkit is a command-line tool that helps you work with CDK applications. You can install it globally using the Node Package Manager (npm):

`npm install -g aws-cdk`


## Step 2: Create a New CDK Project


To create a new CDK project in TypeScript, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project, and run the following command:

`cdk init app --language=typescript`


This command will create a new directory with an initial CDK project structure, including placeholders for your app's source code and unit tests.


## Step 3: Install Dependencies


After creating the project, navigate to the newly created directory and install the project dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`


## Step 4: Bootstrap AWS Environment


Before you can deploy your CDK application, you need to bootstrap the AWS environment you'll be deploying to. This step creates a toolkit stack and other resources required for CDK. Run the following command:

`cdk bootstrap`


This command will prompt you to select the AWS account and region you want to deploy to.


## Step 5: Write Your CDK App


The main source file for your CDK app is located in the `bin` directory. This is where you define your app's stack(s) and resources. You can open this file in your preferred code editor and start writing your infrastructure as code.


## Step 6: Deploy the App


Once you've defined your infrastructure in the CDK app, you can deploy it to your AWS account by running the following command:

`cdk deploy`


This command will synthesize the CloudFormation template and deploy the resources defined in your app. It will prompt you to confirm the deployment and provide the AWS account and region to deploy to.


## Step 7: Development Workflow


As you make changes to your CDK app, you can test them locally by running the following commands:

`npm run build` # Compile TypeScript into JavaScript npm test # Run unit tests


To deploy changes to your AWS account, run the `cdk deploy` command again.


## Step 8: Cleanup (Optional)


If you want to remove the resources created by your CDK app, you can run the following command:

`cdk destroy`


This command will delete all the resources defined in your app from your AWS account.


Congratulations! You've successfully set up and deployed a CDK project in TypeScript. You can now explore the [CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) to learn more about CDK concepts, constructs, and capabilities.
